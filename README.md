does what the name says..
before you run this script you need to install selenium web extension to your browser.

download the version compatible to your system.

HOW TO:
Download the repository folder, unzip it and place on desktop.
Add the txt file of your favorite sub reddits in it.
Run the exe program and type the name of your txt file and press enter.
Then login to your reddit account and press enter on the exe program.
Then wait.
